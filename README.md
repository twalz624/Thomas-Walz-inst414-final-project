# Thomas-Walz-inst414-final-project
This file contains the .ipynb file for the final project I created for my INST414 Data Science Techniques class I took at the University of Maryland College Park. The idea for this project is to consider two potential plans to reduce crime: a custom police notification program and a summer jobs program. I compared these two plans using a large repository of arrest data, creating statistical models in order to find out the pros and cons of each model. The file is meant to be opened using Jupyter Notebook, and needs the requisite csv files to be downloaded on the system reading it, and the call path in the file needs to be edited so that the correct files are referenced.
